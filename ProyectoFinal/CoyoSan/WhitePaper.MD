_Vertical Minnig Pool_ Distroy all crypto blocks in the same line.
_Horizontal Minning Pool_ Distroy all crypto blocks in the same floor.
_Cross Minning Pool_ Distroy all crypto blocks in the same line and floor.
_Ledger Bullet_ Add an extra ledger bullet to Coyo San.
_Double Crush_ Make ledger bullets mine 2 cryptos at ones, in the next turn.
